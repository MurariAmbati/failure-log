# 2026-01-14 - failure log

**day:** wednesday

## failures

**f1: communication breakdown across teams on project scope**

project kicked off without clear ownership of deliverables. three different teams assumed three different definitions of "done." by mid-week, discovered 40% of dev work was solving the wrong problem because spec was interpreted differently in each room. rework required. timeline slipped. stakeholders got the bad news instead of predictable checkpoints.

**f2: knowledge silos preventing effective onboarding**

new team member asked basic questions that nobody could answer cleanly. institutional knowledge lives in individual heads and slack threads from 8 months ago. no runbook, no wiki, no single source of truth. every new person reimplements learning curves from scratch. lost continuity when person with context went on leave.

**f3: escalation process creates defensive behavior instead of resolution**

when issues surfaced, people got anxious about blame instead of focused on fixing. escalation felt like a threat rather than a coordination mechanism. teams started covering their tracks (hoarding context, delayed reporting) instead of collaborating early. trust degraded. incident response was slow because info wasn't flowing.

**f4: meetings without clear decision authority or outcomes**

spent 8 hours in sync this week. left most meetings unclear on: who decides? what's actually blocking us? what's the next step? meetings defaulted to status updates and abstract discussion instead of "here's the decision, here's the rationale, here's who's accountable." follow-up was just more meetings.

## root causes

**rc1 (f1 & f2):** no artifact-first culture. operational knowledge isn't written down, validated, or versioned. people relied on memory and real-time sync. when context switches or people leave, everything fragments.

**rc2 (f3):** escalation got framed as failure instead of information flow. no psychological safety around "we have a problem, let's solve it together." fear-based systems optimize for hiding problems, not solving them.

**rc3 (f4):** no clear decision-making framework. meetings treat everyone's input as equally weighted. no role clarity on who owns the call. results in consensus by exhaustion rather than deliberate decisions.

**systemic:** organization grew faster than process. 6 months ago informal communication worked. now it doesn't but we haven't upgraded the infrastructure. still operating on startup velocity with organization-scale complexity.

## lessons

- async-first and written-first catch misalignment earlier and cheaper than sync-heavy discovery.
- escalation is a feature, not a bug. good escalation processes de-risk projects. bad ones hide problems until they explode.
- decision-making authority needs to be explicit and known in advance. "we'll decide in the meeting" doesn't work at scale.
- knowledge in heads doesn't scale. document what works, version it, maintain it like code.

## resolution & next steps

action items:
- [ ] define and document project spec in shared artifact, get sign-off from all teams
- [ ] create onboarding runbook for new team members, test with next hire
- [ ] redesign escalation process: who can escalate? how? what happens after?
- [ ] establish decision framework: RACI matrix for project decisions, explicit owner for each

longer term:
- [ ] audit existing processes, identify where knowledge is person-dependent
- [ ] restructure meetings: decide on agenda, owner, decision authority before starting
- [ ] build feedback loop: retro on what worked/didn't, update process

## reflection

the organization isn't broken, it's just at an inflection point. the practices that got us here won't get us there. but fixing it requires investment in things that don't feel urgent until they blow up. 

the hard part is that the people here are good. the communication failures aren't because people are bad at communicating—they're systemic. no one person can fix escalation or decision authority. but a few people can redesign the process and get buy-in. that's this week's actual work.
