# 2026-01-15 - failure log

**day:** thursday

## failures

**f1: duplicated effort due to lack of visibility into parallel work**

two team members independently solved the same infrastructure problem. neither knew the other was working on it because status updates were async-only and infrequent. cost: 16 hours of duplicate engineering. root: no single location for "what's in flight."

**f2: knowledge still trapped in PRs instead of docs**

someone solved a tricky config issue in a code change. the solution was buried in commit messages and review threads. next person facing the same issue searched docs, wiki, slack for 2 hours before finding the old PR. decision-making logic wasn't captured as knowledge artifact.

**f3: "artifact-first" talked about but tooling doesn't reflect it**

team agreed yesterday that we need to document better. but when faced with a decision today, defaulted to a quick slack thread instead of writing a brief decision log. no friction protecting the old behavior.

## root causes

**rc1:** no single source of truth for "what's in progress." systems scattered: jira, slack, gdocs, memory. overhead to check everywhere means people don't check.

**rc2:** docs live downstream of decisions. by the time knowledge gets written, context and rationale are lost. docs become post-hoc, incomplete, unhelpful.

**rc3:** inertia. talking about process change is easier than changing the friction of adoption. need process that makes the right thing the *easy* thing.

## lessons

- visibility beats individual optimization. two people solving different parts of the same problem is better than one person solving it twice.
- knowledge artifacts must be *first*, not *last*. decision happens → gets written immediately. not: decide → build → months later → maybe document.
- process change requires removing friction from *desired* behavior, not just pointing at problems. slack is frictionless. wiki isn't. need to reverse that.

## resolution & next steps

- [ ] created a "decisions & in-flight work" board. single place. updated daily async.
- [ ] established rule: no technical decision gets discussed without a 2-min decision log written in real-time (not retroactively).
- [ ] added decision log template to make it actually frictionless (copy-paste, fill 4 fields, done).

## reflection

org problems don't solve with announcements. they solve with systems that make the right choice the *cheaper* choice. we're still early. good news is the problems are organizational, not people. fix the structure, behavior follows.
